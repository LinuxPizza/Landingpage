<p>Q: Why Linux.Pizza?<br />A: Well, you can compile your pizza how much you want and still be able to call it a pizza. The same applies to Linux</p>
<p>Q: What is the purpose of Linux.Pizza?<br />A: I started this project with an entirely different idea in mind, but I soon realized how impossible the idea was for me so I started just setting up different services free for people to use instead.<br /><br />Q: Why do you do this?<br />A: I couldn't first really find anything that was similar to it (I later found disroot.org with a similar approach) and the current tools out there did not offer the user that control they deserve or was hosted on different plattforms or providers. I wanted to make it easier for users to find useful tools that they can use and that respects the users privacy and freedom.</p>
<p>Q: Do you gather any data about your users?<br />A: I am not interested in any data, I just felt the need myself for those tools and other people might aswell use them too free of charge.</p>
<p>Q: Are you going to add more tools/services in the future?<br />A: Yes! Please let me know if you find anything useful!</p>
<p>Q: Why is the Mastodon instance hosted on <a href="https://masto.host">masto.host?</a><br />A: I launched the instance in June 2018 with a few users only. I realized after a few month that it is a time consuming job to manage an instance. Masto.Host was choose because the owner Hugo is a person that I trust, and other people should too. I can recommend that you read the <a href="https://masto.host/tos/">following</a>, with this being said - the goal is to move the instance to our own hardware in 2019.</p>
<p>Q: How do I contact you?<br />A: Feel free to hook me up on <a href="https://social.linux.pizza/@selea">Mastodon</a> or <a href="mailto:admin@selea.se">email</a>. Or if you want to send a more urgent and important message: 0x8B35B3C894B964DD.
<p>Q: Who pays for all this?<br />A: I do, because I want give something back to the community and not just leech from it</p>
<p>Q: You pay for this? Does this mean that you are doing this alone? Who will replace you if you are not available? <br />A: At the moment - I am the only one that is managing the services. Hopefully, my wife can join me in the effort when she has finished her studies. We do have a small moderation team on mastodon and are always looking for people that are interested in contributing everything from being a moderator - to managing a service or five.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Can I donate to the project?<br />A: Sure! I have set up a LiberaPay account so people can donate if they want. Every penny will go back into the project and cover the cost of servers and domain names (such as linux.pizza and temporary-mail.xyz). The goal will increase when more services are added, donating is completely voluntary!<br/><br/> <script src="https://liberapay.com/selea/widgets/receiving.js"></script><br />
