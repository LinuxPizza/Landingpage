<p>Q: Why Linux.Pizza?<br />A: Well, you can compile your pizza how much you want and still be able to call it a pizza. The same applies to Linux</p>
<p>Q: What is the purpose of Linux.Pizza?<br />A: I started this project with an entirely different idea in mind, but I soon realized how impossible the idea was for me so I started just setting up different services free for people to use instead.<br /><br />Q: Why do you do this?<br />A: I could'nt first really find anything that was similar to it (I later found disroot.org with a similar approach) and the current tools out there did not offer the user that control they deserve or was hosted on different plattforms or providers. I wanted to make it easier for users to find useful tools that they can use and that respects the users privacy and freedom.</p>
<p>Q: Do you gather any data about your users?<br />A: I am not interested in any data, I just felt the need myself for those tools and other people might aswell use them too free of charge.</p>
<p>Q: Are you going to add more tools/services in the future?<br />A: Yes! Please let me know if you find anything useful!</p>
